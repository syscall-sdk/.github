syscall-sdk is the missing link between blockchain and reality<br>
while traditional oracles import real-world data to the blockchain, syscall-sdk exports blockchain actions to the real world<br>
syscall-sdk extends the blockchain's capabilities beyond its native environment<br>
with just a single line of code, developers can send emails and sms, post on x (twitter), control telegram bots, or trigger ai agents<br>
